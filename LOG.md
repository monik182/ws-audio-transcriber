## Aug 26
Do not remember for long I've been working on this app.
But as of Aug 26, the latest attempts to make the `/transcribe` API were futile.
The next thing to try is to directly send the blob to OpenAI and make it transcribe it.

## Aug 27
Created the openAI transcribe api and is working fine

Finished the UI to save/delete api key

Not using the firebase function any more
